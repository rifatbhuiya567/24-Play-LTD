                            <p>
                                The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner.

                            <p>
                                The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (â€œopt-outâ€), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
                                </li>

                            </p>
                            <p>

                                These services have the purpose of hosting and running key components of this Application, therefore allowing the provision of this Application from within a unified platform. Such platforms provide a wide range of tools to the Owner â€“ e.g. analytics, user registration, commenting, database management, e-commerce, payment processing â€“ that imply the collection and handling of Personal Data. Some of these services work through geographically distributed servers, making it difficult to determine the actual location where the Personal Data are stored.
