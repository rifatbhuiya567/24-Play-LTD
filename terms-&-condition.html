                            </p>

                                <li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>
                                <li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
                                <li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received. All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</li>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last. If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner's location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.

                            <h5>Coupons</h5>
                            <p>Offers or discounts can be based on Coupons.</p>
                            <p>
                                If breach of the conditions applicable to Coupons occurs, the Owner can legitimately refuse to fulfill its contractual obligations and expressly reserves the right to take appropriate legal action to protect its rights and interests.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Notwithstanding the provisions below, any additional or diverging rules applicable to using the Coupon displayed in the corresponding information page or on the Coupon itself shall always prevail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unless otherwise stated, these rules apply to the use of Coupons:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Each Coupon is only valid when used in the manner and within the timeframe specified on the website and/or the Coupon;</li>
                                <li>A Coupon may only be applied, in its entirety, at the actual time of purchase – partial use is not permitted;</li>
                                <li>Unless otherwise stated, single-use Coupons may only be used once per purchase and therefore may only be applied a single time even in cases involving installment-based purchases;</li>
                                <li>A Coupon cannot be applied cumulatively;</li>
                                <li>The Coupon must be redeemed exclusively within the time specified in the offer. After this period, the Coupon will automatically expire, precluding any possibility for the User to claim the relevant rights, including cash-out;</li>
                                <li>The User is not entitled to any credit/refund/compensation if there is a difference between the value of the Coupon and the redeemed value;</li>
                                <li>The Coupon is intended solely for non–commercial use. Any reproduction, counterfeiting and commercial trade of the Coupon is strictly forbidden, along with any illegal activity related to the purchase and/or use of the Coupon.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Methods of payment</h4>

                                All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Application does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.
                            </p>

                                Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User’s property.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Retention of usage rights</h4>

                            <p>
                                Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Exercising the right of withdrawal</h5>

                                To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.
                            </p>  
                            <h5>When does the withdrawal period expire?</h5>

In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
